# Heart Disease Analysis :heartbeat:
This project aims to conduct different machine learning techniques to a heart disease dataset to gain insights into heart disease. The model training includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, applying K-means clustering, and other clustering techniques, and using principal component analysis (PCA) and t-SNE to visualize the clusters and gain insights into the relationships between the variables.

It also includes using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to identify risk factors associated with heart disease and evaluating the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

## Project Description :man_scientist:
_"You are a data scientist working for a healthcare company, and your task is to analyze a dataset of medical records to identify patients with high risk of developing heart disease. You will use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster patients based on their medical history and identify risk factors associated with heart disease."_

## Dataset :bar_chart:
The dataset used for training and testing the model is from the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease" target="_blank">UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning Repository</a>. It should contain 303 instances with 14 attributes (including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease)
